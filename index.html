<p>This project was borne out of frustration with the many free wedding website template systems out there. I wanted something easy to build, fast to iterate, and conducive to complete customization.</p>

<p>This is currently in pre-alpha stage; no security implementations, no session support, and only a few working components. What does work however is fairly polished.</p>

<p>This is my first large-scale open source project, so bear with me as I learn the ins and outs of github. I will be as responsive as I can be. I would be grateful for any pull requests.</p>
