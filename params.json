{"name":"Wedding-site","tagline":"node.js wedding (or event) website framework","body":"### Wedding (or any other event) Website Framework\r\nThis project was borne out of frustration with the many free wedding website template systems out there. I wanted something easy to build, fast to iterate, and conducive to complete customization.\r\n\r\nThis is currently in pre-alpha stage; no security implementations, no session support, and only a few working components. What does work however is fairly polished.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThis is my first large-scale open source project, so bear with me as I learn the ins and outs of github. I will be as responsive as I can be. I would be grateful for any pull requests.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
